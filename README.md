Chapar aims to be a sidekick for your application, it's not ready yet, and everything may change. 


## Name
Chapar was the old postal service unit in Iran, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapar_Khaneh) 
its a second try to rewrite some code and experiences on an old system, the main job of the system was to send email and notifications, 
so the name Chapar was perfect then, but for some reason, I want to keep the name.
